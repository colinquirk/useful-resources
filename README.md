# Useful Resources

## Data Analysis

#### [Data Wrangling with Dplyr](https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/01/dplyr-tutorial-1/)
A useful overview of less used dplyr functions. The first post in a series of four.

#### [Hadley Wickham Showing Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go5Au01Jrvs)
A video of Hadley Wickham showing how he does exploratory data analysis.

#### [Pandas tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html)
The offical pandas docs sometimes leave a bit to be desired, but the tutorials and exercises here are very useful.

#### [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
The excellent book by Hadley Wickham about all things R related.

## Data Visualization

#### [Data Visualization Checklist](https://datavizchecklist.stephanieevergreen.com/)
A great resource not only for learning about what makes a good visualization, but allows you to check your own figures.

#### [Design for an Audience](http://style.org/ku/)
This is a transcript of an excellent talk from Jonathan Corum, the science graphics editor at the New York Times.

#### [Storytelling With Data](http://storytellingwithdata.com)
Storytelling With Data is a blog all about improving your visualizations. There's often figure fix ups and reader competitions.

## Learning to Program

#### [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
In my opinion, it's the best intro to python book that I've come across. 

#### [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
Codecademy is sometimes criticized as it leaves beginners without an understanding of how to actually write a program. However, as a bare bones intro or syntax refresher I think it does a great job. Just pair it with a book afterwards.

#### [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex)
Sentdex has amazing video tutorials for almost everything you could want to do with data in python.

## Machine Learning

#### [fast.ai](http://fast.ai)
Fast.ai has both a deep learning course and a (currently unlisted) basic machine learning course.

#### [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com)
Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions. The titanic dataset is a good place to start.

## Miscellaneous

#### [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown)
These are a series of excellent math tutorials. 3Blue1Brown uses beautiful visualizations to try to make complex topics clear, and focuses on teaching at a conceptual level. I found the linear algebra course to be particularly useful.

#### [New and Improved Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
The old version of this tutorial was incredibly helpful for making my website. It's comprehensive and now up-to-date.

#### [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
A thorough description of R Markdown and everything you can do with it.

#### [Speeding up R Package Installation](http://www.rexamine.com/2015/07/speeding-up-r-package-installation-process/)
Really useful for slower computers.

## Packages/Tools

#### [Altair](http://altair-viz.github.io)
This package allows you to create graphs declaratively, similar to ggplot. However, it is made for python and sits ontop of D3.js, so interactive plots can be made easily. 

#### [Data Illustrator](http://www.data-illustrator.com/)
I haven't tried this, but it looks like an interesting tool for interactively building plots without code. 

## Statistics

#### [Calculating Effect Sizes](https://osf.io/6zxd2/)
A useful article describing how to calculate effect sizes in a number of different situations, including spreadsheets to do the calculations. 

#### [Stan Intro](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2018/04/17/stan-intro.html)
This is a great intro to stan using a practical example workflow.
