A video of Hadley Wickham showing how he does exploratory data analysis.

#### [Pandas tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html)
The offical pandas docs sometimes leave a bit to be desired, but the tutorials and exercises here are very useful.

## Data Visualization

#### [Data Visualization Checklist](https://datavizchecklist.stephanieevergreen.com/)
A great resource not only for learning about what makes a good visualization, but allows you to check your own figures.

#### [Storytelling With Data](storytellingwithdata.com)
Storytelling With Data is a blog all about improving your visualizations. There's often figure fix ups and reader competitions.

## Machine Learning

#### [fast.ai](fast.ai)
Fast.ai has both a deep learning course and a (currently unlisted) basic machine learning course.

#### [Kaggle](kaggle.com)
Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions. The titanic dataset is a good place to start.

## Miscellaneous 

## Packages/Tools

#### [Altair](altair-viz.github.io)
This package allows you to create graphs declaratively, similar to ggplot. However, it is made for python and sits ontop of D3.js, so interactive plots can be made easily. 

#### [Data Illustrator](http://www.data-illustrator.com/)
I haven't tried this, but it looks like an interesting tool for interactively building plots without code.
